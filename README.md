## Rust Playground
In an attempt to replicate the python plaground command, I've created this repository that more or less allows you to execute code within a main function step by step.
It is still a work in progress and will likely not allow for std inputs or outputs. 
### Installation
* Simply clone this repository and run `cargo install --path .` from within the directory.
* After this is done you can execute `cargo playground` in order to use things.

### Todo(for now):
* Remove ability to use std operations
* Add to crates.io
* Create tests and benchmarks
* Enable autocomplete of methods
* Enable imports and usage of dependencies
